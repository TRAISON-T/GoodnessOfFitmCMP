\title{Goodness-of-Fit Tests for the mCMP Distribution}
\usage{
goodness_of_fit_mCMP(x, B = 1000, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of observed sample data (non-negative integers).}

\item{B}{An integer for the number of bootstrap runs. Default is 1000. A larger number provides
more accurate p-values but takes longer to compute.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress messages during the bootstrap iterations.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{estimated_mu}: The estimated location parameter \eqn{\mu} of the mCMP distribution.
\item \code{estimated_phi}: The estimated dispersion parameter \eqn{\phi} of the mCMP distribution.
\item \code{p_value}: A named numeric vector of p-values for each test statistic (CV, AD, chi_sq, CV_M, AD_M, PD).
These p-values indicate the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme
than the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
\item \code{obs_stats}: A named numeric vector of the observed test statistics calculated from the input data \code{x}.

\description{
Performs goodness-of-fit tests for the mean-reparametrized Conway-Maxwell Poisson (mCMP) distribution using bootstrap methodology.
The mCMP distribution is a two-parameter generalization of the Poisson distribution capable of modeling
equi-, under-, and over-dispersed count data. Assessing the adequacy of fit is crucial in data analysis.
This function implements proposed modified goodness-of-fit tests based on Stein's characterization:
the modified Cramér-von Mises (\eqn{CV_M}), modified Anderson-Darling (\eqn{AD_M}),
and Probability Distance (\eqn{PD}) tests. These tests overcome the computational complexity
associated with the normalizing constant in the mCMP probability mass function.
For comparison, it also includes the traditional Cramér-von Mises (CV),
Anderson-Darling (AD), and Chi-square (\eqn{\chi^2}) tests.

The p-values for these test statistics are computed using a bootstrap procedure. This is necessary
because the exact distributions of these test statistics under the null hypothesis
(that the data comes from an mCMP distribution) are generally difficult to obtain.
The parameters \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\phi} of the mCMP distribution are estimated internally
by minimizing the Probability Distance (\eqn{PD}) objective function, \eqn{S(\mu,\phi)}.

# Example data (from the paper's simulation study)
x <- c(12, 8, 9, 11, 9, 10, 12, 9, 12, 4, 11, 8, 12, 12, 9, 8, 9, 10,
       15, 11, 14, 11, 9, 7, 15, 11, 13, 9, 15, 8, 7, 11)

# Run the goodness-of-fit test. Use a smaller B for quick examples;
# B=1000 or more is typically recommended for real analysis.
gof_result <- goodness_of_fit_mCMP(x, B = 100, verbose = FALSE)

Title: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for the mean reparametrized COM-Poisson Distribution
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Traison T
Maintainer: Traison T <t.traison@gmail.com>
Description: Implements goodness-of-fit tests for the Conway-Maxwell Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution based on Stein's characterization. The package provides functions to calculate the probability mass function, generate random samples, and perform modified Cramér-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and probability distance tests. These tests are computationally efficient as they overcome the normalizing constant issue in the COM-Poisson distribution's probability mass function.
